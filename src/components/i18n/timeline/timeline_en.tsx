                Regularly reading the CD-Action computer magazine, I came across
                it to the introductory section of HTML and PHP.
              </p>
              <p>
                I didn't have internet at home, so I learned to create my first
                websites only locally, copying code from a magazine.
              </p>
              <p>
                The code editor was Windows Notepad, which wasn't making
                learning easier, just like the most popular browser at the time
                - Internet Explorer (version 5).

                My first earning experience was distributing advertising
                newspapers.
              </p>
              <p>
                I received packages of advertising newspapers from multi-branch
                chain stores, which I then packed in disposable plastic bags and
                hung them on door handles in blocks of flats and on gates of
                single-family houses.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was going to junior high school then, and earning money that
                way was nice pocket money.

              <p>
                With a few friends from the block, we set up a local computer
                network.
              </p>
              <p>
                I took over the setup and operation of the router by
                administering the network to which everyone was connected.
              </p>
              <p>
                That was also the beginning of my adventure with security and
                "hacking".
              </p>
              <p>
                Under the guise of network problems with one of my colleagues
                (having previously unplugged his cable from the router), I
                visited him and, as part of diagnosing the problem, activated
                remote access on his system.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also had to watch out for files uploaded by others, because
                very often they were Trojans.
              </p>

                Korzystanie z komunikatora LANChat nauczyło mnie też, że
                prywatne rozmowy nie są tak naprawdę prywatne, gdy komunikator
                wysyła wiadomości po sieci w formie nieszyfrowanej.

              <p>
                My first website was devoted to my then hobbies, i.e.
                skateboarding and fingerboarding (a miniature version).
              </p>
              <p>
                On the website, I posted instructions for creating my own,
                original version of the fingerboard and described how to perform
                tricks, including self-made 3D animations.
              </p>
              <p>
                I learned 3D graphics program (Caligari trueSpace) similarly to
                HTML and PHP - thanks to CD-Action magazine.
              </p>
              <p>
                To publish the website, I used free hosting offered by Wirtualna
                Polska - Webpark.
              </p>
              <p>The disk space was "dizzying" and amounted to several MB.</p>
              <p>
                From the technical side, it was a classic, i.e. HTML/CSS,
                JavaScript and PHP.
              </p>
              <p>
                The website contained dynamic elements such as a clock showing
                the current time or the ability to sign in the guest book. There
                was also an option to complete a survey through which I
                collected feedback from users.
              </p>
              <p>
                The graphic design style I would now call "dark mode". However,
                this was long before the term became fashionable.
              </p>
              <p>
                In retrospect, I can see that I have always had a desire to
                share knowledge, and the Internet turned out to be the perfect
                medium.

                After graduating from a junior high school in Poland, I started
                the next stage of my education in Chicago, USA.
              </p>
              <p>
                Walking into school was like checking in at the airport. Each
                backpack was scanned on a tape that passed through an X-ray
                machine, and each student passed through a metal-detection gate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Learning the subjects was a big challenge. Biology, math,
                geography, etc., were all taught in English, which I wasn't very
                fluent at the time.

              <p>For a short period I tried my hand at construction.</p>
              <p>
                At work, I learned terms like two-by-four or two-by-six to
                describe the cross-sections of rectangular timber (wood planks)
                used to build most American homes.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, two-by-four meant 2 inches by 4 inches rectangular
                timber.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, I learned to efficiently use imperial units of
                measurement, measuring the appropriate lengths of boards, which
                I then cut.
              </p>
              <p>I also learned how to use a nail gun.</p>

                Slicing meat and cheese by weight, serving salads to customers,
                cleaning up after the end of the shift. This was more or less my
                next job.
              </p>
              <p>
                One day, one of my co-workers didn't turn off the slicer after
                he had finished slicing. When I wanted to use it, it cut off a
                piece of my finger.
              </p>
              <p>I then resigned from further work there.</p>

                After returning to Poland, I started studying at a hotel
                technical school. It was a mistake. I would certainly use this
                time better by attending an IT technical school.
              </p>
              <p>
                My grades in most subjects were poor and I didn't apply myself
                to study. The exception was computer science, in which I had an
                excellent grade on my final certificate.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, for 4 years of studying at a technical school,
                every year I took part in a school typing competition,
                consistently taking 1st place in it. In this way, I won useful
                computer equipment: a wireless mouse, a webcam or a flash drive.

                Learning with the driving instructor went smoothly and I was

              <p>
                However, the practical exam itself, i.e. the situation in which
                I was assessed during the performance of tasks, paralyzed my
                abilities.
              </p>

                Nevertheless, I passed the exam on the first try, although
                already at the first intersection, the car died twice when I was

                After graduating from high school and passing my final exams, I
                went to Wrocław.
              </p>
              <p>I started my studies in the field of "Computer Graphics".</p>
              <p>
                However, quite quickly, after the 1st semester, I resigned from
                further studies. I saw no value in gaining knowledge this way.
              </p>
              <p>
                I learned much more effectively on my own, using courses, books
                or online tutorials.
              </p>
              <p>
                I developed my skills in the field of computer graphics and web
                development, following the ever-growing curiosity in these
                areas.

                As an advisor in the computer department, I was helping clients
                choose equipment and diagnosed complaint defects.
              </p>
              <p>In the meantime, I focused on personal development.</p>
              <p>
                I was interested in, for example, speed reading and mnemonics.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the help of picture stories, I memorized product numbers
                from price lists to check, at the customer's request, whether
                additional pieces of a given product were available in stock.

              <p>I designed and implemented the entire business from A to Z.</p>
              <p>
                Conducting recruitment interviews in person was one of the most
                difficult challenges in terms of "getting out of the comfort
                zone".
              </p>
              <p>
                I created an informative website, designed leaflets, which I
                later distributed around homes.
              </p>
              <p>
                I commissioned a commercial to be recorded and aired on a local
                radio station.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the end, I managed to acquire only two clients and after a
                few months I closed the company.
              </p>
              <p>
                I had no idea about this industry and felt no desire to explore
                it further.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, I noticed that I was very involved in creating
                graphics, advertising materials, and a website.

                At that time, Allegro made it possible to place HTML code on
                auctions. So I started creating and selling Allegro auction
                templates.
              </p>
              <p>
                These were individual projects, but also mass equivalents in the
                form of ready-made templates that customers could choose from my
                catalog.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, I created a template generator in PHP, to which I
                sold access in the{" "}
                <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service"

                model.
              </p>
              <p>
                Getting to know SOAP WebAPI, which was made available by
                Allegro, I also offered an automatic after-sales service,
                configuration of actions such as sending a message after the
                payment was booked, e.g. after buying a top-up code.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, I sold the website together with the created software.

                Taking advantage of the possibility of 100% remote work as a
                creator of video courses, I decided to move to Asia.
              </p>
              <p>

              </p>
              <p>
                However, I was more drawn to living in a big city than on a
                small paradise island, so after a month I moved to Kuala Lumpur,
                Malaysia.
              </p>
              <p>
                I rented an apartment there in an apartment building with a
                swimming pool and set up an office in it.
              </p>
              <p>
                The tourist visa allowed me to stay for 3 months from entering
                Malaysia, so I was visiting the surrounding countries - Thailand
                and Singapore - to extend my visa for the next quarters.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, I lived in Asia for almost a year, experiencing the
                pros and cons of remote work before it became ubiquitous in IT.

                However, I noticed a problem that had not affected me before.
              </p>
              <p>
                The amount of knowledge and experience in the field of web
                development that I gathered was much greater than before, when I
                originally started my adventure with web development courses.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, the topics that interested me, in which I wanted to
                develop, became more and more specialized and less interesting
                for a wider audience.
              </p>
              <p>
                So I started thinking about returning to a full-time job, which
                would allow me to further develop my web development skills.

                For a long time I have been interested in sim racing, racing in

                cars in the physical world as faithfully as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the opportunity arose to check how sim racing actually
                translates into real driving on the track, I decided to take
                part.

                I launched a project - a free JavaScript email course in the
                form of 100 lessons sent daily with an example of a hidden error
                in the JavaScript code.

                I decided to return to the path of a full-time career as a web
                developer.

                Solving real problems related to software development, working
                with programmers from whom I can learn, seems to be the best way
                to further develop my skills.
