                Regularly reading the CD-Action computer magazine, I came across
                it to the introductory section of HTML and PHP.
              </p>
              <p>
                I didn't have internet at home, so I learned to create my first
                websites only locally, copying code from a magazine.
              </p>
              <p>
                The code editor was Windows Notepad, which wasn't making
                learning easier, just like the most popular browser at the time
                - Internet Explorer (version 5).

                My first earning experience was distributing advertising
                newspapers.
              </p>
              <p>
                I received packages of advertising newspapers from multi-branch
                chain stores, which I then packed in disposable plastic bags and
                hung them on door handles in blocks of flats and on gates of
                single-family houses.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was going to junior high school then, and earning money that
                way was nice pocket money.

                With a few friends from the block, we set up a local computer
                network.
              </p>
              <p>
                I took over the setup and operation of the router by
                administering the network to which everyone was connected.
              </p>
              <p>
                That was also the beginning of my adventure with security and
                "hacking".
              </p>
              <p>
                Under the guise of network problems with one of my colleagues
                (having previously unplugged his cable from the router), I
                visited him and, as part of diagnosing the problem, activated
                remote access on his system.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also had to watch out for files uploaded by others, because
                very often they were Trojans.

                Korzystanie z komunikatora LANChat nauczyło mnie też, że

                My first website was devoted to my then hobbies, i.e.
                skateboarding and fingerboarding (a miniature version).
              </p>
              <p>
                On the website, I posted instructions for creating my own,
                original version of the fingerboard and described how to perform
                tricks, including self-made 3D animations.
              </p>
              <p>
                I learned 3D graphics program (Caligari trueSpace) similarly to
                HTML and PHP - thanks to CD-Action magazine.
              </p>
              <p>
                To publish the website, I used free hosting offered by Wirtualna
                Polska - Webpark.
              </p>
              <p>The disk space was "dizzying" and amounted to several MB.</p>
              <p>
                From the technical side, it was a classic, i.e. HTML/CSS,
                JavaScript and PHP.
              </p>
              <p>
                The website contained dynamic elements such as a clock showing
                the current time or the ability to sign in the guest book. There
                was also an option to complete a survey through which I
                collected feedback from users.
              </p>
              <p>
                The graphic design style I would now call "dark mode". However,
                this was long before the term became fashionable.
              </p>
              <p>
                In retrospect, I can see that I have always had a desire to
                share knowledge, and the Internet turned out to be the perfect
                medium.

                After graduating from a junior high school in Poland, I started
                the next stage of my education in Chicago, USA.
              </p>
              <p>
                Walking into school was like checking in at the airport. Each
                backpack was scanned on a tape that passed through an X-ray
                machine, and each student passed through a metal-detection gate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Learning the subjects was a big challenge. Biology, math,
                geography, etc., were all taught in English, which I wasn't very
                fluent at the time.

              <p>For a short period I tried my hand at construction.</p>
              <p>
                At work, I learned terms like two-by-four or two-by-six to
                describe the cross-sections of rectangular timber (wood planks)
                used to build most American homes.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, two-by-four meant 2 inches by 4 inches rectangular
                timber.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, I learned to efficiently use imperial units of
                measurement, measuring the appropriate lengths of boards, which
                I then cut.
              </p>
              <p>I also learned how to use a nail gun.</p>

              <p>
                One day, one of my co-workers didn't turn off the slicer after
                he had finished slicing. When I wanted to use it, it cut off a
                piece of my finger.
              </p>
              <p>I then resigned from further work there.</p>

                After returning to Poland, I started studying at a hotel
                technical school. It was a mistake. I would certainly use this
                time better by attending an IT technical school.
              </p>
              <p>
                My grades in most subjects were poor and I didn't apply myself
                to study. The exception was computer science, in which I had an
                excellent grade on my final certificate.
              </p>

                In addition, for 4 years of studying at a technical school,
                every year I took part in a school typing competition,
                consistently taking 1st place in it. In this way, I won useful
                computer equipment: a wireless mouse, a webcam or a flash drive.

                I learned much more effectively on my own, using courses, books

                Getting to know SOAP WebAPI, which was made available by
                Allegro, I also offered an automatic after-sales service,
                configuration of actions such as sending a message after the

                A friend encouraged me to work in the company where he worked as
                a day trader, i.e. a broker performing buy/sell operations on
                stock exchanges within a single day (short-term speculation).

                However, I was more drawn to living in a big city than on a

                Malaysia.

              <p>
                I rented an apartment there in an apartment building with a

              <p>
                The tourist visa allowed me to stay for 3 months from entering
                Malaysia, so I was visiting the surrounding countries - Thailand
                and Singapore - to extend my visa for the next quarters.
              </p>

                However, I noticed a problem that had not affected me before.
              </p>
              <p>
                The amount of knowledge and experience in the field of web
                development that I gathered was much greater than before, when I
                originally started my adventure with web development courses.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, the topics that interested me, in which I wanted to
                develop, became more and more specialized and less interesting
                for a wider audience.
              </p>
              <p>
                So I started thinking about returning to a full-time job, which
                would allow me to further develop my web development skills.

                For a long time I have been interested in sim racing, racing in
                simulation-type games, i.e. games that imitate the behavior of
                cars in the physical world as faithfully as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the opportunity arose to check how sim racing actually
                translates into real driving on the track, I decided to take
                part.
